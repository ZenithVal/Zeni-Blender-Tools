# Zeni Blender Tools
Zeni's blender tools. I didn't want a million split up tabs. 

## Transfer Shape Keys
Uses Surface Deform to batch transfer all shapekeys from one mesh to another. Supports a mask on the target mesh and transferring to more than one selected mesh at a time.

## TODO
 - Port over various functions that I care for from [CATs](https://github.com/ZenithVal/cats-blender-plugin)
 - Low Poly subsurf generator for easy outfit fitting via mesh deform.
 - Think of more useful things.
 - Explode, I guess.
